# Procedural-Generation-Sandbox
A repository for me to fiddle around with procedural generation. 
As of July 21, 2018, I feel like I did what I set out to do. While I would like to learn a bit more about Perlin Noise, 
I don't have anything to apply Perlin Noise to, such as a 3d model or terrain generation. However, I learned a lot when 
programing the BSP Tree and when I was exploring BSP Trees, I learned different applications for it. 

## BSP Tree
I implemented the BSP Tree to generate rooms of a dungeon for a hypotheical video game. The blue rectangles are rooms
and the green lines are halls that connect those rooms. I started to fiddle around with the BSP Tree more but I decided that 
if I were to change it, I should it in a different repo to keep code organized.
